# Stock-Models
Find my stock prediction models here.
First I build a DecisionTreeRegressor and LinearRegression model to predict stock price on S&P five year data. LinearRegression seemed to work well and predicted similar stock trend.

I made another model from scratch using LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices on 'GOOGL' dataset, which I loaded from yahoo finance. The model generated a RMSE of 4.44, with prediction accuracy of 99%.

# Stock-Models
Find my stock prediction models here.

First I build a DecisionTreeRegressor and LinearRegression model to predict stock price on S&P five-year data. LinearRegression seemed to work well and predicted a similar stock trend.

I made another model from scratch using LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices on the 'GOOGL' dataset, which I loaded from yahoo finance. The model generated an RMSE of 4.44, with a prediction accuracy of 99%.
